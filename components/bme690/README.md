# BME690 Sensor API adapted for ESP-IDF
This code is an adaptation of https://github.com/boschsensortec/BME690_SensorAPI for ESP-IDF.
Only works with i2c bus, not SPI.

## Getting Started with this IDF component
This component is published on the [ESP-IDF Component Registry](https://components.espressif.com/components/francisduvivier/bme690_sensorapi_espidf).

Check the [test_apps](./test_apps) directory for example code on how to use the BME690 Sensor API with ESP-IDF.
